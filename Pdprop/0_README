Welcome to the "Pdprop" Crack Propagation Simulation Programs.

When you read this you are in a  folder called "Pdprop".
In this folder there are two items:
    1. 0_README      this text file
    2. CleanPdprop   a folder that contains the software.

After a new download:
In order to run properly the programs will probably need to 
be compiled in your system.  This can be done with 
the following commands:

      cd CleanPdprop

      ./Allcompile

The script "Allcompile" will create new vesions of the Fortran
binary (runtime) programs.  Note that you will need the Linux
compilers
    "gfortran"  and  "gcc"
and 
    "gnuplot"   (plotting softwere)
    "htmldoc"   (converts html to pdf file)

available in your system. Just type the command "gfortran -v"
etc.  now to see if they are there.  If any are not there
ask your SysAdmin person to please install them.

Check the output from Allcompile to see if there are any errors.
If all looks ok,  you are ready to run simulations.

Suggestion:
  The files involved are not that large, so probably the best
way to run a simulation is to copy the entire "CleanPdprop" folder
to some new location for each problem.  e.g.:

       cp -r CleanProp   /home/username/newProblemName

   The copied folder will then have all the files and programs  usable 
(or alterable)  for your new crack propagation problem.

    For running a problem, go into the problem file folder e.g.:
        cd /home/username/newProblemName/

and use the command:
        ls
to see the available problem type folders.  At present there
are three available:
        PlateSurfFlaw,   PlateLongSurfFlaw, and  PipeInSurfFlaw

Select one of the three and cd into it. e.g.:
        cd PlateSurfFlaw

In that folder run the setup file to help you define your problem 
simulation. e.g.:
        ./setup1

There are sample files in the folder to allow you to make a test run. 
If you wish to define a new problem you will need to alter or insert 
new versions of:

         problem environment file  e.g.:  pdprop.env
         dadn file                 e.g.:  a36+1015.dadn
         history file              e.g.:  load1.txt
         material file             e.g.:  merged_a36_fitted.html

Take a look at each one now, to see what you will need for
your problem's simulation.  The folder PlateSurfFlaw  contains all the
files for a typical run,  and also all the output files that are generated
by a run (except the huge data file from the simulation run).  
At the end of a sim. run use makereport 
    e.g.:        ./makereport1 {simulationOutputFilename}
to make an html and a pdf report file. (don't type the { } brackets).

Good Luck,
Al
