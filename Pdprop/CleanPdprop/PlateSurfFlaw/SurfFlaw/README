There appears to be no visible diff between files 
  t2_MmMb_Surflaw_90
and 
  t_MmMb_Surflaw_90    with altered format for aoc
when plotted using the  gnuplot commands:
gnuplot> set grid
gnuplot> splot "t_MmMb_Surflaw_90" u 3:4:6 w l, "t2_MmMb_Surflaw_90" u 3:4:6 w l
or
gnuplot> splot "t_MmMb_Surflaw_90" u 3:4:7 w l, "t2_MmMb_Surflaw_90" u 3:4:7 w l 




There is a very slight difference close to aoc =0.0  or 0.0002 
when one plots:
gnuplot> splot "t_MmMb_Surflaw_00" u 3:4:5 w l, "t2_MmMb_Surflaw_00" u 3:4:5 w l 
or
gnuplot> splot "t_MmMb_Surflaw_00" u 3:4:6 w l, "t2_MmMb_Surflaw_00" u 3:4:6 w l 

but it is negligible.  All the other points seem to be overtop of each
other.


Thus we can safely use the slightly older files 

    t_MmMb_Surflaw_90
and 
    t_MmMb_Surflaw_00
especially since aoc  probably never gets that close to  0.0
